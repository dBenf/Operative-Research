# Ricerca-Operativa
This repository contains the solutions proposed for the final project of the Ricerca Operativa course (AY 20/21) at the University of Naples Federico II.

## Project
The project's solution is based on the **Hack@Napoli** hackathon **"Lâ€™astronave scientifica Ruthig"** provided by *Math2B s.r.l.* on 4th June 2021.
The aim of the project is to try to fill your spaceship's containers to the maximum while trying to visit as many planets as possible with the fuel at your disposal.
